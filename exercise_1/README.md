Exercise 1
In this exercise I will be working with data from the "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services(CMS)Hospital Compare" project.
I will be downloading the dataset which are in csv format and loading the data into HDFS Data Lake. I will further transform the data lake to fit my data model and analyze the derived data to answer the following questions:
1.What hospitals are models of high-quality care? i.e. which hospitals have the most consistently high scores for a variety of procedures.
2.What states are models of high-quality care?
3.WHich procedures have the greatest variability between hospitals?
4.Are average scores for hospital quality or procedural variability correlated with patient survey responses?

I will be making use of HIVE, SPARK SQL, pyspark to complete this task
